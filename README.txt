# Conways Game Of Life
## Built in Unity3D
## Language : C#

### How-To Run
- Open the Scene "MainScene" within the Scenes folder.
- Press Play
- Press S to stop the simulation
- Press R to reload the scene

How To Edit The Board
- Open Board.cs and change _width and _height
- Keep in mind it is running in Unity and loading sprites, so 50*50 is 2500 sprites.
- On a less powerful computer, you can try out 10x10 or 20x20.

Fixes Needed
- Initial starting stage is a randomized tile set of dead or alive (Needs to follow rules)
- Optimization for performance, so we can use larger tile sets.
